# Do-It-Yourself (DIY) CETEIcean

A workspace for publishing [Text Encoding Initiative](https://tei-c.org/) (TEI) XML documents with [CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean). CETEIcean works by translating your XML elements into HTML “custom elements” — preserving your encoding while giving you the ability to control how it is displayed.

<!--You can style your document with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). You can also change how an element is interpreted with Javascript behaviors.-->

The brilliance of CETEIcean is in its power and flexibility. CETEIcean has the potential to lower the barrier on publishing XML. All you need to get started is a text editor and a browser. To further customize your web page, all you’ll use are popular web technologies such as [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). In other words, you don’t need any fancy resources or obscure knowledge to use CETEIcean. But you can _get_ fancy as you become more comfortable using your tools.

This DIY workspace is intended to be approachable, low-tech scaffolding for getting started with CETEIcean.
